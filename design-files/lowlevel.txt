Low Level Design for FEWD Capstone

State
	var destinations = [];

	var leg=[destination[legCounter], destination[legCounter+1];

	var legCounter = 0 //starts at 0 and goes up by 1 every time principle information function is called
	function to push user destination inputs into array

	var legData  ={startPoint: {geocode: {latitude: number,
	  				      longitude: number},
				    weather: {}
				   },
		       endPoint: {geocode: {latitude: number,
                                   	    longitude: number},
                        	  weather: {}

		       midPoint: {geocode: {latitude: number,
                                   	    longitude: number},
                        	  weather: {}
                       		  },

		       0.5point: {geocode: {latitude: number,
                                   	    longitude: number},
                        	  weather: {}
                        	 },
		       1.5point: {geocode: {latitude: number,
                                   	    longitude: number},
                        	  weather: {}
                        	 },	
		      }



State Manipulation Section

	function to update leg
		leg.push(destination[legCounter])
		leg.push(desintation[legCounter+1])
	
	function to update startPoint and endPoint
		calls return geocode data function and sets the startPoint.geocode and endPoint.geocode to returned data

	function to calculate geocode for midpoint between start and end i.e. midpoint
	function to calculate geocode for midpoint between start and Geo-1 i.e 0.5point
	function to calculate geocode for midpoint between Geo-1 and end i.e. 1.5point
		


Weather Tomfoolery Section
	function to create rain mapmarker //these may be variables
	function to create thunderstorm mapmarker
	function to create snow mapmarker
		etc etc

	function that gets weather data for each geocode and updates the points weather object.

Map Tomfoolery Section
	function that creates url for staticmap
		function that creates start point marker
		function that creates endpoint marker
		function that creates midpoint marker
			calls weather marker determiner
		function that creates 0.5 marker
			calls weather marker determiner
		function that creates 1.5 marker
			calls weather marker determiner
		function that determines which weather marker to use depending on weather results

DOM Manipulation Section
	function to add destinations in user input form
	
	function to suggest destinations by user input i.e. Hou ---> Houston, TX?	
	
	Principle information function
		calls function to render google map
		calls function to render eventbrite events
		calls function to show route data
			Travel Time
			Distance
	
	function to cycle back through legs if we are on the last leg
		if (legCounter == destination.length - 1) {
			legCounter = 0;
			}

API Section
	Get Section
		function to get data from EventBrite API
		function to get data from OpenWeather API
		function to get data from Google Maps API
		function to get data from Google Geocode API

	Data Manipulation Section
		function to render google map for specific leg
			Start: destination[leg]
			End: desination[leg+1]

		function to render eventbrite events
		function to return geocode data

Event Watch Section
	function that watches for add destination button
		calls add destination function
	
	function that watches for form submit
		calls principle information function to render everything

	function that watches for forward  navigation button
		increments legCounter by 1
		calls principle information function to rerender
	
	function that watches for backward navigation button
		decrements legCounter by 1
		calls principle information function to rerender
